# .target sm_121 - it drops the architecture-specific suffix, and then every
# instruction this codebase depends on fails to assemble: the FP4 conversions,
# the block-scaled mma, all of it. -gencode arch=compute_121a,code=sm_121a is
# the form that keeps it. The build asserts the emitted target rather than
# trusting the flag.
