// DeepSeek V4 Flash. Shapes and constants only.
//
// AUDITED against deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Flash, 2026-07-27. The shapes below
// match. What does NOT match is the amount of the architecture that is
// implemented, and the list is here rather than in a tracker because the next
// person to read this file is the one who needs it.
//
// THERE ARE TWO TARGETS UNDER THIS NAME, and they differ where it is least
// visible. Flash is 43 layers at hidden 4096 and its first two layers are pure
// sliding window. Pro is 61 layers at hidden 7168 and its first two layers are
// HIGH-COMPRESSION, not sliding window. Everything after is CSA and HCA
// interleaved in both. A layer-kind table written for one is wrong for the
// other in exactly the two positions nobody checks. This config is Flash.
//
// FIVE GAPS BETWEEN THIS CONFIG AND A MODEL THAT DECODES CORRECTLY:
//
// 1. THE LAYER-KIND TABLE IS NOT HERE AT ALL. The reference carries
//    compress_ratios, 44 entries reading [0,0,4,128,4,128,...,4,0]: ratio 0 is
//    sliding-window attention, 4 is compressed sparse attention with the
//    indexer, 128 is high-compression. unity.cu exports ONE
//    Dsv4LayerAttentionFp8. Three kinds, one entry point, and nothing selects.
//
// 2. DUAL ROPE IS DECLARED AND UNREACHABLE. DSV4_ROPE_THETA and
//    DSV4_COMPRESS_ROPE_THETA are both below and correct - 10000 for the
//    ratio-0 layers, 160000 with YaRN for the rest - but one entry point
//    cannot choose between them, so the second is dead.
//
// 3. ROPE PAIRING IS WRONG FOR THIS CHECKPOINT. LmRopePerHeadKernel pairs
//    index with index + rope_dim/2, the half-split convention. The reference
//    encodes INTERLEAVED pairs, view_as_complex style, pairing 2i with 2i+1.
//    These are different rotations. Half-split is right for GLM 5.2, which is
//    presumably why it is what the kernel does; DSV4 needs either a pairing
//    mode on the kernel or a permutation at pack time.
//
// 4. HASH ROUTING ON THE FIRST LAYERS IS MISSING. num_hash_layers defaults to
//    3: those blocks route through a hash gate with a token-id to expert-id
//    table, not through the router. The MoE path here has no such branch.
//
// 5. HYPER-CONNECTIONS ARE MISSING ENTIRELY. Every block carries hc_mult=4
//    streams of the hidden state across the stage boundary, mixed by a
//    Sinkhorn-normalised doubly-stochastic matrix. Nothing in the buffers
//    carries four streams, so this is not a kernel gap but a shape gap - the
//    residual is a different object than the one the layer assumes.
//
// The reference bringup was validated at 0.998 final-logits cosine against the
// official implementation. That is the bar, and none of it is reachable until
// at least 1, 2 and 3 exist.
//
// Closest to GLM 5.2 of the five: one KV head at 512 dims is a latent in all but
// name, and the sparse index is the same mechanism at a different top-k. What
// differs is a sliding window on top of the sparse selection, and two rope
// thetas - one for the compressed path, one for the rest.
